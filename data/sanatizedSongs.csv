Chris Brown,Loyal (feat. Lil Wayne & Tyga),"Hi, Im the Rap Critic Lets stop talking about Chris Brown Lets talk about someone else, anyone else Whats top 5 on the Rap charts Pitbulll STILL Show Me Already reviewed that Monster No, I need to lay off Eminem for a while Who else My Nigga my nigga, my nigga my nigga Hm Stoner as soon as I figure out what hes saying, Ill get back to you Wow, man Nothing good to review on the Rap Charts Well, whats on the pop charts that has featured rappers on it Chris Brown sigh Okay, fine, Ill talk about this song, from Chris Brown Okay, lets have a listen You thought it was over I kinda hoped I know these hoes aint right When a rich nigga want you, and your nigga cant do nothing for ya These hoes aint loyal Wait, didnt I JUST review a song about women cheating on their boyfriends Whats Love Yeah, not JUST a song about having sex with a girl, or just a couple of oneoff lines about someone isnt faithful, no, thats not good enough THE PREMISE OF THESE SONGS are SPECIFICALLY about taking someone elses lover These hoes aint loyal The thing is, this isnt like most songs nowadays that are so busy, you can ignore the lyrics Here, he says the lyric, followed by 3 awkwardly long seconds of silence, and it directly draws your attention to his message But hold up, maybe Im just too stricken by the similarity of the last song to make a fair judgement of this one, maybe I should judge the song on its own merit, and not directly compare it to another one that I didnt like I should try to look at it with fresh eyes Okay, my palettes cleansed Alright, hit me, Chris Brown oh, dammit I wasnt born last night Oh wait, this song starts with a verse from Wayne, because because of course it does I wasnt born last night, I know these hoes aint right I think women are evil But oddly enough, theyre my biggest fan base Life is stupid like that But you was blowin up her phone last night But she aint have her ring nor her ring on last night A quick service announcement to all men out there if you just recently found out that youve been cheated on, for the love of God, do NOT turn to the hiphop station on your radio scenario Guy Gets in his car I cant believe my girl would be so unfaithful, man I I need to hear some loud raucous rap music to get my mind off of things turns on radio Thats why I fucked your bitch I can fuck your bitch Ill take your biiiiitch WE GETTIN TURNT UP WE GETTIN TURNT UP WE GETTIN TURNT UP WHILE WERE HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSES WIFE WE GETTIN TURNT UP WE GETTIN TURNT UP I DONT RESPECT RELATIONSHIPS Why give a bitch your inch when she rather have nine Ooooh, some kinda clever wordplay Now see, heres the thing if youre gonna be a douchebag, at least be clever about it So, what else ya got You know how the game goes, she be mine by half time Okay, you get a point for continuing some serviceable wordplay Im the shit Oh God Please, no more poop jokes Weve had enough from you Its not cool anymore, its definitely not smooth montage of poop jokes Youve referred to yourself as feces so much, and in so many descriptively disgusting ways, my mind doesnt even register that its supposed a euphemism for being awesome anymore It just sounds like youre actually bragging about being human waste And I will ignore the low hanging fruit that stems from you constantly admitting to being human waste, in order to say Wayne theres no humor in it, youve thoroughly deconstructed all various angles at which one can extract references to crap in relation to complementing ones self, I beg you GIVE IT A REST sighs But, since hes already set it up, you know hes gonna say it So go ahead Lil Wayne, compel us with your latest comparison to defecation Im the shit, ooh  nigga, thats that nerve Wait no poop joke No wornout, tired, uninspired wordplay about doo doo Im the shit, ooh  nigga, thats that nerve You all about her, and she all about hers Wow I gotta say, I I respect that Its almost like hes growing as an artist Okay, now back to the topic of disrespecting women Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos And I done did everything but trust these hoes Hey, Wayne about not trusting these hoes, as it were, um dont you have, like 4 kids with 4 different women I mean, I know thats a little personal, but if youve got 4 kids with 4 baby mamas, that would suggest youve trusted quite a few hoes, particularly with birth control options Oh Im sorry, I was being thoughtlessly disrespectful to the mothers of his children What were we talking about again These hoes aint loyal Yeah, yeah but wait a minute Maybe I shouldnt be so mean I should give these guys the benefit of a doubt And you know why Because these guys live in a different world than I do Let me explain Okay, these guys are rich, and money attracts people, but that doesnt mean it necessarily attract better people, it just attracts MORE people, and the simple fact is, a LOT of people are douchebags, especially those who think they can get over on people with money And, ipso facto, women are going to be among this collection of douchebags, but where the guys who are douchebags can only do so much when it comes to trying to get some money from them, women have the persuasive advantage of sexuality on their side, which no doubt makes their requests for money and material items a little harder to resist In fact, the duplicitous nature of these scandalous women is further exacerbated by knowing that some of them have boyfriends that they are completely willing to cheat on without a second thought in order to achieve their shallow goals And so, this song is made with that disgust in mind, scoffing at women who would sink so low as to betray the trust of a lover in exchange for diamonds and fancy clothes Thats a sentiment I guess I can get behind Took a broke niggas bitch Wait, so YOURE the one whos actively trying to have sex with HER When A rich nigga want ya And your nigga cant do nothing for ya  Well, then you suck, too In fact, who the hell are you to judge her Seriously, you dis these women for being shallow because shes only interested in your money, but how much better are you, since youre only interested in her body Both of you are equally shallow jackwagons, because You BOTH know that theres someone whos going to be hurt by what youre doing, and you seem to revel in that fact And you know what maybe you couldve justify this somewhat by adding in some lines about how her boyfriend cheated on her, and shes getting revenge, or maybe he hasnt been home a lot, and she just wanted to be intimate with someone again, but NOPE Shes just a ho who trades sex for the chance that youll spend money on her Took a broke niggas bitch, I can make a broke bitch rich But I dont fuck with broke bitches Sooo you took someones girl and claimed that you can make this broke girl rich but you dont mess with broke girls so did you NOT do the first thing you just said you did Because Im pretty sure taking someones girl counts as messing with them But hey, lets go with the other possible interpretation of this awkwardly worded lyric ultimately, hes saying that he only talks to girls who have their own money, and since these girls he exclusively talks to are already financially stable, that eliminates the chances of them being gold diggers, and maybe he can meet girls who are interested in him because of his start laughing sweet, kind, loving personality HAHAHAHA Oh, God, thats too funny Got a white girl with some fake titties And Im sure youre really interested in her sweet loving personality She wanna see a nigga trapped Yeah, sh ye yeah She wanna fuck all the rappers Uh what was that part about girls with big boobs trying to get you trapped Well, maybe, hes just talking about the type of girls I mentioned before that only use sex in order to influence guys to get them fancy clothes and whatnot But wait, you made it clear that you dont deal with broke women Im pretty sure most broke girls cant afford breast implants, especially not with broke boyfriends, so like you said, you only talk to rich girls, the type of girls that dont need your money anyway so which is it, Chris Girls who are already rich and dont need your money, or girls who want to exploit your exploitation of themor lack of proofreading OR maybe hes saying something else there She wanna see a nigga TRAP She wanna fuck all the rappers Maybe hes saying that she wants to see him trap, like trapping, you know, the latest metaphor for selling drugs Well, in that case, maam, youre fresh out of luck, because Chris Brown is not a rapper, and he damned sure doesnt sell drugs Speaking of which though, isnt there another rapper on this song that we have to get through Maybe hell lend some some cohesive story or give some focus to this song Okay, lets talk about this ice that Im carryin Eh, lets not Come on, come on, girl, why you frontin Baby show me something Um hold on When I call her, she gon leave And I bet that bottom dollar she gon cheat Are you sure about that Come on, come on, girl Why you frontin Baby show me something If so, why does it sound like youre begging her I mean, you could say shes teasing him or something, but that doesnt match up with the rest of the song, where he painted himself as being such a dominant alpha male who took charge of the situation, women just couldnt help but throw themselves at his feet I mean, he seemed pretty confident in his thesis statement These hoes aint loyal So why, all of a sudden, is he having a hard time with her These hoes aint loyal I swear, theyre not, shes gonna call back, just give it a second Seriously, it sounds like things arent working out as well for him So, when I hear this Come on, come on, girl Why you frontin Baby show me something You just spent your bread on her And its all for nothing He sounds like the bad guy in a movie who thinks the love interest is going to double cross the hero, but doesnt realize that its not going to happen Haha After all the love and affection you gave her, your lady friend was on my side the entire time Take him down, Katherine I said, she was on MY side the entire time Take em down, Katherine Katherine cocks gun Oh raises hands oh Anyways, my ultimate problem with this song is that its not really catchy, but where the production would usually make up for that in these types of songs, here, its just kinda limp and inoffensive, and awkwardly unfitting for the topic of the song, which I have no choice but to pay close attention to, and whats revealed is a bunch of jackasses without morals and writing that doesnt showcase a lot of consistency One minute hes taking broke girls from broke men, and the next he doesnt like broke girls because theyre shallow and materialistic, all the while the only thing he wants to do is have sex with them Its spiteful, hateful, and oddly enough tries to act like its okay, almost as if he doesnt realize exactly how spiteful and hateful it is, and the bouncy, happy synth line just adds to the confusion You know, I think another problem I have is that, usually these types of songs about cheating on your boyfriend are justified by something intimate being wrong with the relationship, like the girl wasnt being treated with respect, or, hell, he wasnt listening to her in the bedroom, you know, theres something primal or emotional thats not being responded to due to negligence on the part of the man in question that the singer is taking over for, but here, the only flaw on the part of the other man thats addressed is He doesnt have enough money, which, needless to say, isnt that much of a character flaw, at least not to my poor person brain I dunno, maybe to rich people, being poor is the equivalent of drowning puppies And so I have to ask, who is this song for He doesnt even really seem interested in pleasing her sexually or emotionally, which lets me know that this song CANT be for the ladies, aside from the fact that hes calling out every girl he meets as a ho, but it CANT be for the fellas, because they never address the other man in the third person, no, theyre talking DIRECTLY to you, the listener with the girlfriend, so I have no choice but to assume this song is purely for terrible people who wish to align with this sort of thinking and sing along to it while they cheat on theyre spouses, which hey, I guess those people need their music too, but even so, these guys are so wrapped up in themselves, they never really try to make it appealing to the listener, they just kinda put out this dickish personality as is and expect you to think its cool on principal, not giving a second thought to how they actually present their personas, and I just dont like it Id give this a rating, but that would be validating Chris Brown as a rapper well, Im the Rap Critic most of the time you dont have to like my But wait, you may be asking, arent there several different versions of this song Theres one with Too Short and one with French Montana You should review those too look blankly No, I shouldnt end",0

back there Applejack Dont worry, yall Well let Principal Celestia know all about this and those girls will be kicked to the curb in no time Last thing she needs is another CHS event almost ruined by some powercrazed lunatic Er, no offense Sunset Shimmer None taken Principal Celestia Dark magic I find that very hard to believe Those girls came into my office earlier and were absolutely delightful Vice Principal Luna Ugh Perhaps Sunset Shimmer is just eager to make someone else out to be a bad element, so that her actions at the Fall Formal will become old news Sunset Shimmer I could see why you might think that, but Rainbow Dash Thats not whats happening We saw all of this go down in the cafeteria too Principal Celestia Yes, but isnt your band supposed to be part of the Musical Showcase Rainbow Dash Yes Vice Principal Luna Perhaps youre all just worried that the Dazzlings will steal your spotlight Applejack The Dazzlings Principal Celestia Its the name of their musical group Thats why they came by my office earlier today  to sign up for the Showcase Even sang a little song to Vice Principal Luna and I Applejack They did Principal Celestia Yes And we think having a Battle of the Bands instead is a marvelous idea Fluttershy I cant believe they got to Principal Celestia and Vice Principal Luna too Rainbow Dash Theyve gotten to everybody Pinkie Pie Not everybody Applejack Pinkie Pies right We were there when the Dazzlings were singin and we werent affected It was like we were protected somehow Rainbow Dash So lets take them down Its not like we havent tangled with dark magic before and totally whooped its sorry butt Uh, no offense Sunset Shimmer None taken Again Fluttershy But that was when Twilight was here There may be some kind of magic inside us, but it only comes out when we play music I sure dont know how to use it to whoop anybodys butt Rarity If only we could get a message to Twilight Maybe she could tell us how to break the spell the Dazzlings have cast on our friends Rainbow Dash Well, thats not gonna happen The portals closed Rarity Rainbow Dash And I get the feeling they dont exactly have cell phones where shes from Sunset Shimmer I may have an idea how we can get in touch with Princess Twilight Sunset Shimmer When I was Princess Celestias student back in Equestria, she gave me this Even after I abandoned my studies, I held onto it Deep down, I guess I knew I was making a big mistake, and I wanted to still have a way to reach out to her Maybe it still works Rarity Thats a book, darling What do you mean, maybe still works Sunset Shimmer It used to be that if I wrote something here, it would appear in the pages of a book back in Princess Celestias library I get a message to her, then she can get a message to Princess Twilight Rainbow Dash So what are you waiting for Get to writing Sunset Shimmer Been a long time since Ive written these words Dear Princess Celestia Delivery Pony Excuse me, Princess Where do you want all these books from Princess Celestia Twilight Sparkle The library Third door on the left Delivery Pony Even this one thats glowin and vibratin Fluttershy What is it, Twilight Twilight Sparkle It looks like a message to Princess Celestia from my friends at Canterlot High Rarity How is that even possible Twilight Sparkle I have no idea, but it sounds like they need my help Twilight Sparkle The way Sunset Shimmer described them, I think these new girls sound an awful lot like the sirens Pinkie Pie Not the sirens I dont actually know what that is Twilight Sparkle The sirens were three beautiful but dangerous creatures who had the power to charm ponies with their music But to maintain this power, they had to feed on the negativity and distrust of others The more of this negative energy they consumed, the stronger their voices became, and the farther they could spread their dark magic Fluttershy I dont think I like this story very much Twilight Sparkle If the sirens had their way, they would have divided and conquered all of Equestria But a certain Star Swirl the Bearded wasnt having it Rumor has it he found a way to banish them to another world  one where he believed their magic power would be lost That world must have been the one where my Canterlot High friends live Applejack But Star Swirl must have sent them there ages ago How come theyre just surfacin now Twilight Sparkle I dont know But if my hunch is right and it is the sirens who have come to Canterlot High, this spell theyve cast is just the beginning My friends need me I have to get back to them Rainbow Dash I hate to burst your bubble, Twilight, but the connection between their world and Equestria will still be totally cut off for a super long time Pinkie Pie Okay, first of all, if there was bubbleblowing going on, why wasnt I told about it And secondly, if the connection is totally cut off, how was Sunset Shimmer able to get a message to Twilight Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, youre a genius Pinkie Pie Yeah, I get that a lot Now about those bubbles Twilight Sparkle And the interval between the two points is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the separation between the points along three spatial dimensions Spike Say what now Pinkie Pie Duh Shes gonna take the magic in here and put it in there Thatll make the portal open up so that whenever she wants to, she can go from here to there There to here Here to there Here there Here there Here Applejack We get the idea Twilight Sparkle Now to see if it actually works Main cast Ooooh Main cast Ahhhhh Applejack Dont suppose we could join you this time around Twilight Sparkle Better not It could make things pretty confusing if Canterlot High all of a sudden had two of all of you Rest of main cast Spike But I still get to go, right There isnt another one of me at Canterlot High And you never know if you might need your trusty assistant Twilight Sparkle Mmhmm Spike Yes Twilight Sparkle We wont be gone long Main cast Fluttershy Oh, you be careful, Twilight Rainbow Dash Take care Applejack Yall be safe now Rarity And dont forget to dress well Pinkie Pie Twilight Sparkle Ready, Spike Spike Ready Rainbow Dash Im starting to think shes not coming Sunset Shimmer, Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie Twilight Twilight Sparkle Oof Im back Rest of main cast Twilight Sparkle And Ive got some bad news about those new girls Rest of main cast Rarity Oh, I do hate that you had to return at a time of crisis Theres so much catching up to do Applejack For starters, a certain bluehaired guitar player was just askin about you Twilight Sparkle Flash Sentry was asking about me Isnt that nice Rarity Perhaps you would give us just the slightest bit of gossip from your world Spike Shes got an official title now The Princess of Friendship Sunset Shimmer Wow, thats really impressive Guess you really were Princess Celestias prized pupil Spike Shes even got her own castle Rarity A castle You have your own castle Eh Ooh, uh, lovely Twilight Sparkle Whats new here I mean, besides your school becoming the target of dangerous magical creatures from Equestria Rainbow Dash Yeah, so, that isnt exactly the only strange thing thats happened since you left Pretty sweet, huh It happens to all of us when we play Twilight Sparkle Hmm My crown was returned to Equestria, but some of its magic must have remained here at Canterlot High Now that were all back together, we can use that magic on the sirens Just like when we were able to use it on Sunset Shimmer when she turned into that horrifyingly awful winged monster No offense Sunset Shimmer None taken Heh Im used to it Rainbow Dash Theyll never even know what hit em Applejack Weve got nothin to worry about now that Twilights back Fluttershy Oh, Im pretty sure I could find something to worry about But it wont be the sirens Twilight Sparkle The sooner we do this, the better Any idea where the Dazzlings might be Pinkie Pie Theres a big party tonight for all the bands who signed up to be in the showcase That would include the Dazzlings Twilight Sparkle Looks like weve got a party to crash Pinkie Pie Flash Sentry Im gonna get more punch Flash Sentry Twilight Twilight Sparkle Eh, bumped, into, always, doing Flash Sentry What are you doing here You came back for the big competition, right Twilight Sparkle Something like that Flash Sentry Huh Not that theres gonna be any real competition No one here wants this as bad as my band does Twilight Sparkle Can you excuse me for just a minute Adagio Dazzle Oh, no No ones mingling Its like theres some kind of underlying tension that could bubble to the surface at any minute Sonata Dusk Its the fruit punch, isnt it I knew I used too much grape juice Adagio Dazzle Its not the fruit punch Its us Aria Blaze But the punch is awful, too Sonata Dusk What do you know about good fruit punch Aria Blaze More than you Sonata Dusk Do not Aria Blaze Do too Adagio Dazzle This is just the kickoff party, girls Imagine what a tizzy theyll be in by the time the Battle of the Bands starts Twilight Sparkle There isnt going to be a Battle of the Bands Were gonna make sure of that Alright, girls, lets do this Friendship is magic Rainbow Dash Uh, werent there rainbows and lasers and stuff last time Twilight Sparkle I dont understand Were all together again Why isnt this working Spike You, uh really need to go ahead and do that whole magic of friendship thing now Twilight Sparkle Im trying, Spike I thought the six of us standing together against the sirens would bring out the magic we needed to defeat them Thats what happened before Adagio Dazzle Talk about throwing down the gauntlet This group is obviously serious about winning A little cocky though, arent they Claiming there wont really be a battle Seems they think they already got this thing all locked up Trixie Lulamoon Not if the Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie has anything to do with it Flash Sentry Whatever, Trixie Were the best band at CHS Apple Bloom No The Crusaders are gonna win Adagio Dazzle I think we may have found what were looking for Or rather, it found us Aria Blaze Adagio Dazzle Magic Dont you see Everyone else has fallen under our spell But not these girls These girls are special Twilight Sparkle It doesnt make any sense I should have been able to create the spark that would help us break their spell Thats how it worked before Sunset Shimmer But to defeat me, you drew magic from the crown I was wearing The sirens magic comes from their music So maybe you have to use the same kind of magic to defeat them Or maybe not Twilight Sparkle No I think youre onto something Sunset Shimmer Really Twilight Sparkle Its when you play music that you transform now, right Applejack Yup Ears, tails, the whole shebang Twilight Sparkle So maybe the way to use that magic to defeat the sirens is by playing a musical counterspell Fluttershy You mean like a song Twilight Sparkle Uhhuh And in order to free everyone whos been exposed to the sirens spell, well need them all to hear it Rest of main cast Hmmm Rarity The band competition Thats the next time we can be certain everyone will be in the same place at the same time Applejack Guess the Rainbooms are the band to beat Rarity And I believe you, Twilight, just became the Rainbooms newest member Rest of main cast Pinkie Pie So what do you wanna play Triangle Sousaphone Theremin Soooo magical Twilight Sparkle I might take a little too long to learn how to play something with these Ill just sing Rainbow Dash Like, as in, lead singer Cuz thats usually my gig This being my band and all Applejack Its our band And, of course, as lead singer Shes the one with the magical knowhow to help us pull this thing off Rainbow Dash Okay, yeah, thats cool Ill just use this as a chance to hone my already insanely good lead guitar skills Twilight Sparkle Its only temporary And we dont have to win the Battle of the Bands We just have to perform during the first round of the competition Rainbow Dash Lets get to learning that musical counterspell Twilight Sparkle Well, thats just it I dont know any Rest of main cast Awww Twilight Sparkle But Im sure I could figure out how to write one Spike Totally Twilight can write a spell like its nobodys business Thats pretty much how she got to become a princess in Equestria Twilight Sparkle Technically, I helped finish a spell And there was a little more to it than that, Spike Spike Yeah, whatever Twilight Sparkle Ive got this Cmon Applejack Wherere you goin Twilight Sparkle Well, last time we were here, Spike and I spent the night in the library Pinkie Pie Are you crazy Were besties now Slumber party at my house Pinkie Pie Status update Okiedokielokie Rainbow Dash Applejack Hey I was about to beat you Rainbow Dash I doubt it So, Twilight, how is that counterspell comin Twilight Sparkle Huh Oh, uh, good Great Thanks for letting me use your notebook, Fluttershy I really like the song you wrote for the Rainbooms Fluttershy Thanks Hopefully one day, well get a chance to play it Rainbow Dash Applejack Hey Rarity Twilight, I think I speak for all of us when I say I dont know what we would have done if you hadnt come back to help us Rest of main cast Uhhuh Applejack Darn tootin Pinkie Pie Pizzas here Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie Dont you want any pizza Rest of main cast Twilight Sparkle No Thats not gonna work Sunset Shimmer Hey, Twilight Youre up late Twilight Sparkle Just looking over the counterspell We only get one shot at this It has to be perfect Sunset Shimmer We really are lucky youre here Twilight Sparkle Thats what everyone keeps telling me Sunset Shimmer Who could possibly need this much whipped cream Must be nice to have everyone always looking to you for answers to their problems instead of waiting for you to cause a problem Twilight Sparkle Just because everyone expects something from you doesnt mean its guaranteed to happen Sunset Shimmer Well, that doesnt stop them from expecting it Twilight Sparkle Which only makes things harder because the last thing you want to do is Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer let everybody down Sunset Shimmer Waaah Maud Boulder was hungry Sunset Shimmer I still cant get over the fact that shes related to Pinkie Pie Twilight Sparkle You and me both Sunset Shimmer I better get some sleep Good luck with the counterspell Not that youll need it This must be nothing compared with the stuff youre expected to deal with as a princess in Equestria Twilight Sparkle Sunset Shimmer Never mind Its not important No, I have to be able to do this I have to Hey, hey, listen Weve got a message for you Were not all alike But our friendship is true Yeah, were really different But we still get along So hey, hey, listen to our song You may think youre in control But were here to prove you wrong With the friendship in our music With the power of our song Gonna stomp our feet, clap our hands With the magic of friendship Gonna stop your evil plan Spike Eh, that sounded way better than the last five times youve played it Heh heh Big McIntosh Nnope Spike Rainbow Dash I think its pretty obvious whats going wrong with this counterspell Applejack Youre turnin what should be the chorus into a fiveminute guitar solo Rainbow Dash I have to pick up the slack somehow Are you guys even trying Fluttershy Im trying Twilight Sparkle Its fine Itll be fine One more time from the top Rarity Or, perhaps we could take a short break, try on some of the wardrobe choices Ive put together Im particularly fond of this one Eh, of course we could always go with something a bit more modern Applejack Were tryin to save our school here Enough with the costumes Rarity Oh, you can never have enough costumes Pinkie Pie She just wants to make things fun Isnt that what being in a band supposed to be Sunset Shimmer You dont have time for any of this Youre supposed to check in at the Battle of the Bands in fifteen minutes Main cast Oh, no Twilight Sparkle What But its not ready If we play our counterspell in the first round and it doesnt work, the sirens will know what were up to and make sure we dont get a chance to play it again Applejack Then well have to buy ourselves some time so you can keep workin on it Rarity But how do you propose we do that Rainbow Dash We compete in the Battle of the Bands for real I take over lead vocals again and we stay alive until the finals We unleash the counterspell then Youll have figured it out by finals, right Spike Of course she will Twilight Sparkles never met a problem she couldnt solve Right, Twilight Twilight Sparkle Right Rainbow Dash Then lets go win us a Battle of the Bands Principal Celestia Welcome to the first ever Canterlot High School Battle of the Bands I believe I speak for everyone when I say it is by far the greatest thing we have ever done here at this school Principal Celestia We are so glad our three newest students encouraged us to turn this event into something exciting Vice Principal Luna But, as this is now a competition, we can only choose one winner Who is it going to be Male Student Youre the worst thing to happen Adagio Dazzle You feel that, girls Our true power is being restored Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk Adagio Dazzle And thats before weve tapped into the strongest magic here Aria Blaze But the Rainblossoms, or whatever theyre called, arent under our spell How exactly are we supposed to get to their magic Adagio Dazzle The Rainbooms are just as capable of falling apart as anyone else They just need a little push in the wrong direction I have a feeling everyone here is going to be lining up to give them a shove Aw, yeah Snips and Snails indahouse, yo They call me MC Snips and that aint no lie My favorite food is like pumpkin pie Im DJ Snazzy Snails, I like whales When I go to the beach, I always bring my pails Everybody knows my favorite color is orange My rhymes are so fly, theyre better than um Than an

rock Pinkie Pie Wait Wheres Rarity Rarity Oh Here Im here Rarity We will be performing in front of an audience Im not going to wear something fabulous Hmph Applejack Guh Twilight Sparkle Remember, we have to be good enough to make it through but not so good we let the sirens see the magic within us They could realize we plan to use it against them Rainbow Dash Got it Be cool enough to win, but not so cool that we end up showing off the whole ears and tails and rainbows thing Sooo about twenty percent less cool Pinkie Pie One Two Weve just got the day to get ready And theres only so much time to lose Because tonight, yeah, were here to party So lets think of something fun to do We dont know we dont know whats gonna happen We just know we just know its gonna feel right All our friends are here

Principal Celestia and Vice Principal Luna Rarity Ruined Absolutely ruined Applejack Rarity, were you tryin to make us lose out there Rarity Wh Oh This was not my fault This was an act of sabotage Applejack Yeah, well, whoever did this couldnt have done this if you didnt insist on dressin like like this We need to sound good Is there some reason that concept seems to escape you Rainbow Dash And what was with the confetti, Pinkie Pie How am I supposed to shred if theres paper stuck in my frets Fluttershy It was pretty distracting Pinkie Pie Ugh Says the girl who was running from a light the whole time A light Sunset Shimmer You still sounded much better than most of the other bands Im sure youll make it to the next round But it wont matter if you dont have that counterspell ready You all find a place to practice where the sirens cant hear you Ill keep an eye on things around here Derpy Twilight Sparkle I dont think we should use a classroom We really need to stop bumping into each other like this Flash Sentry Uh, you guys hear something Drummer Uhhuhh Bassist Aw, nope Twilight Sparkle I said, we have to stop Flash Sentry There it is again So annoying Twilight Sparkle Why are you acting like this I thought we were friends Flash Sentry Yeah, and then you decide to come back here just so you can beat me in the Battle of the Bands I want this, Twilight, and youre trying to take it from me Some friend Twilight Sparkle Thats not why Applejack Come on, Twilight Weve got things to do Flash Sentry You really think youre gonna help them Ha I bet you have no idea what youre even doing Adagio Dazzle Tears already This is only the first round Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk Principal Celestia The next band to take the stage will be Trixie and the Illusions Adagio Dazzle Better head back Were supposed to go on after Trixie Sunset Shimmer Youre never gonna get away with this Adagio Dazzle Why Because you didnt Oh, we know all about you, Sunset Shimmer Youve got quite the reputation at Canterlot High Sunset Shimmer Ive changed Im in a much better place now Aria Blaze Waiting in the wings while your friends have all the fun Adagio Dazzle Oh, yes, you girls are so tight And yet they didnt ask you to be in the band Aria Blaze Probably afraid no one would want to see them play if she was in the group Sonata Dusk Too bad So sad Adagio Dazzle If its any consolation, no one is going to remember you at all by the time were done Adagio Dazzle Remember, girls We want to save the good stuff for when our full power has been restored Ohwhoaoh, ohwhoaoh You didnt know that

deal with the situation Sunset Shimmer Im sorry, I just wanted to help Rainbow Dash Yeah, well, you didnt Applejack None of this wouldve happened if you werent tryin to show off  as usual Trixie Lulamoon Good show, Rainbrooms I especially liked the part where Sunset Shimmer, in a fit of jealous rage, knocked out Rainbow Dash midguitar solo Sunset Shimmer It wasnt a fit of jealous rage Trixie Lulamoon If you say so Ooh Looks like theyve already decided wholl be moving on to the finals Im guessing it wasnt too difficult a decision The Dazzlings Sunset Shimmer Huh Rarity What can we do There isnt gonna be another opportunity for us to play And I had the most gorgeous outfit for the finals Applejack Yup, cause thats the real tragedy here, Rarity  that you wont get to play dressup Rarity You know perfectly well that is not what I meant Rainbow Dash You guys wanna keep it down Theyre about to announce whos moving on Fluttershy Who are you kidding You know it isnt gonna be us Principal Celestia The band that will be joining the Dazzlings in tonights finals The Rainbooms Trixie Lulamoon What Main cast Huh Pinkie Pie Did they just say, the Rainbooms Trixie Lulamoon This isnt over

Dash Yeah, well not as much as we are Crowd Photo Finish Zis never should haf been you, Rainbooms Crowd Trixie Lulamoon This is a travesty A travesty Adagio Dazzle It really is The Rainbooms dont deserve to be in the finals Not when your band was so much better in the semis Aria Blaze And wanted it so much more Adagio Dazzle Alas, this is the way its going to be Dazzlings vs Rainbooms Sonata Dusk Unless, of course, the Rainbooms dont manage to make it to their set or held up for some reason Trixie Lulamoon Hmm Rainbow Dash Check, one, two Testing, testing Testing Fluttershy This doesnt make any sense We were awful Doesnt anybody else think its strange that were the ones that made it to the finals Trixie Lulamoon Very strange Rainbow Dash What are you doing here, Trixie Pretty sure the losers are supposed to be up there in the cheap seats Trixie Lulamoon The Great and Powerful Trixie is the most talented girl at Canterlot High It is I who deserves to be in the finals And I will not be denied Rainbooms and Sunset Shimmer Trixie Lulamoon See you never Adagio Dazzle Told you someone would give them a shove Sonata Dusk She didnt shove them She pulled a lever Aria Blaze Go back

powerful and greaeaeat Oh, whoa, oh oh oh oh Rainbow Dash Applejack Give it up, Rainbow Dash Youve been tryin at this for hours Its not gonna open Twilight Sparkle Maybe it doesnt even matter that were trapped down here I dont think the counterspell would have worked anyway Applejack Of course it would have worked, Twilight Assumin a certain band member didnt try to hog the spotlight the whole time we were tryin to play it Rainbow Dash Hey If you wanna tell Twilight shes getting a little too caught up trying to be the new leader of this band, you dont have to be all cryptic about it Rarity She was talking about you, Rainbow Dash Rainbow Dash Me Im just trying to make sure my band rocks as hard as it needs to Rarity, Applejack, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie OUR BAND Twilight Sparkle But why wasnt it working I should know what to do How could I not know what to do How could I have failed like this Applejack It mightve been your idea to start a band, but its not just your band, Rainbow Dash Rainbow Dash Im the one who writes all the songs Fluttershy I write songs You just never let us play any of them Rarity I had the most perfect outfits for us to wear Applejack Again with the costumes No one cares what were wearin Rarity I care, Applejack So sorry if I enjoy trying to make a creative contribution to the band Pinkie Pie Hey Anybody here remember fun Ill give you a hint Its the exact opposite of being in the Rainbooms Rainbow Dash I wish I never asked any of you to be in my band Rarity I wish Id never agreed to be in it Fluttershy and Applejack Me neither Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity and Pinkie Pie Ya better believe I got tricks up my sleeve See me dominate Cause Im powerful and greaeaeat Trixie Lulamoon Try to top that Adagio Dazzle Oh, gosh I dont

what theyve been after all along Theyre feeding off of the magic inside you Applejack How can they be using our magic Its the magic of friendship Sunset Shimmer Ever since you started this band, youve been letting little things get to you I never said anything cause I didnt feel like it was my place Not when Im so new to this whole friendship thing I still have a lot to learn But I do know that if you dont work out even the smallest problems right at the start, the magic of friendship can be turned into something else Twilight Sparkle I cant believe all this tension was happening right under my nose and I didnt realize it Im supposed to be the one with all the answers And all Ive done since I got here is let you down Sunset Shimmer I dont think anyone is supposed to have all the answers But you can count on your friends to help you find them Twilight Sparkle I think you already have Cmon We need to get out of here Twilight Sparkle Spike Spike Sorry I took so long I had to find somebody who wasnt under the sirens spell to help me get you out Twilight Sparkle Why isnt she under their spell Spike Never takes off her headphones Applejack Come on, yall Time to prove weve still got the magic of friendship inside us Twilight Sparkle And theres only one way to do it Pinkie Pie Were getting the band back together Rainbow Dash Were getting our band back together Pinkie Pie Whee Rarity Ooh, which version of the counterspell are we going to play Twilight Sparkle I dont think it matters what song we play, as long as we play it together as friends Rainbow Dash I know just the song Fluttershys written a really great one Fluttershy Applejack Were about to save the world here Personally, I think we should do it in style Rarity Rarity I thought youd never ask Ahha, ahahah, ahahah

survives, survives We will be adored Tell us that you want us We wont be ignored Its time for our reward Crowd Sunset Shimmer Guess that explains why these were so special to them Twilight Sparkle Without those pendants and the magic you brought here from Equestria, theyre just three harmless teenage girls Flash Sentry Rainbooms rule That was amazing Sunset Shimmer and Main cast sans Twilight Trixie Lulamoon You may have vanquished the Dazzlings, but you will never have the amazing, showstopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie Main cast, Sunset Shimmer, and Flash Sentry Pinkie Pie Shes gone Oh, wait There she is Trixie Lulamoon Trixies okay Rainbow Dash You know, Twilight is going back to Equestria soon The Rainbooms could really use someone to help Fluttershy on backup vocals Sunset Shimmer I also play guitar Rainbow Dash Well see Applejack Sure wish you could stay longer Twilight Sparkle Me too But I have responsibilities in Equestria that I have to get back to Its citizens need me But now I can go through the portal whenever I need to This isnt goodbye Its just goodbye til next time Ready Spike Ready Sunset Shimmer Dear Princess Twilight, Missing you already,

comes alive We sing our songs to lift us up so we can shine And the sound that we hear in our hearts Makes a crescendo And the light that ignites in the dark It makes us all glow And shine like rainbows We shine like rainbows Together we stand As the rain begins to fall And holdin our heads up high As the sun shines through it all And the sound that we hear in our hearts Makes a crescendo And the light that ignites in the dark It makes us all glow And shine like rainbows We shine like rainbows Shine like rainbows We shine like rainbows We shine like rainbows Human Twilight Sparkle No
