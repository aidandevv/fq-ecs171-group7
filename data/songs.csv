I kinda hoped… I know these hoes ain't right When a rich nigga want you, and your nigga can't do nothing for ya These hoes ain't loyal… Wait, didn't I JUST review a song about women cheating on their boyfriends? *""What's Love""* Yeah, not JUST a song about having sex with a girl, or just a couple of one-off lines about someone isn't faithful, no, that's not good enough. THE PREMISE OF THESE SONGS are SPECIFICALLY about taking someone else's lover These hoes ain't loyal… The thing is, this isn't like most songs nowadays that are so busy, you can ignore the lyrics. Here, he says the lyric, followed by 3 awkwardly long seconds of silence, and it directly draws your attention to his message. But hold up, maybe I'm just too stricken by the similarity of the last song to make a fair judgement of this one, maybe I should judge the song on it's own merit, and not directly compare it to another one that I didn't like. I should try to look at it with fresh eyes. Okay, my palette's cleansed. Alright, hit me, Chris Brown… oh, dammit… I wasn't born last night Oh wait, this song starts with a verse from Wayne, because… because of course it does… I wasn't born last night, I know these hoes ain't right I think women are evil! But oddly enough, they're my biggest fan base. Life is stupid like that… But you was blowin' up her phone last night But she ain't have her ring nor her ring on last night …A quick service announcement to all men out there: if you just recently found out that you've been cheated on, for the love of God, do NOT turn to the hiphop station on your radio *scenario* Guy: *Gets in his car* I can't believe my girl would be so unfaithful, man. I… I need to hear some loud raucous rap music to get my mind off of things! *turns on radio* *""That's why I fucked your bitch"" ""I can fuck your bitch"" ""I'll take your biiiiitch…"" ""WE GETTIN' TURNT UP! WE GETTIN' TURNT UP! WE GETTIN' TURNT UP WHILE WE'RE HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S WIFE! WE GETTIN' TURNT UP! WE GETTIN' TURNT UP! I DON'T RESPECT RELATIONSHIPS!"" Why give a bitch your inch when she rather have nine? Ooooh, some kinda clever wordplay. Now see, here's the thing: if you're gonna be a douchebag, at least be clever about it. So, what else ya got? You know how the game goes, she be mine by half time Okay, you get a point for continuing some serviceable wordplay I'm the shit-- Oh God. Please, no more poop jokes. We've had enough from you. It's not cool anymore, it's definitely not smooth *montage of poop jokes* You've referred to yourself as feces so much, and in so many descriptively disgusting ways, my mind doesn't even register that it's supposed a euphemism for being awesome anymore. It just sounds like you're actually bragging about being human waste. And… I will ignore the low hanging fruit that stems from you constantly admitting to being human waste, in order to say Wayne: there's no humor in it, you've thoroughly deconstructed all various angles at which one can extract references to crap in relation to complementing one's self, I beg you: GIVE IT A REST!!!! *sighs* But, since he's already set it up, you know he's gonna say it. So go ahead Lil Wayne, compel us with your latest comparison to defecation I'm the shit, ooh - nigga, that's that nerve Wait… no poop joke? No worn-out, tired, uninspired wordplay about doo doo? I'm the shit, ooh - nigga, that's that nerve You all about her, and she all about hers Wow. I gotta say, I… I respect that. It's almost like he's growing as an artist. Okay, now back to the topic of disrespecting women Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos And I done did everything but trust these hoes Hey, Wayne… about ""not trusting these hoes"", as it were, um… don't you have, like 4 kids with 4 different women? I mean, I know that's a little personal, but if you've got 4 kids with 4 baby mamas, that would suggest you've trusted quite a few hoes, particularly with birth control options Oh I'm sorry, I was being thoughtlessly disrespectful to the mothers of his children. What were we talking about again? These hoes ain't loyal… Yeah, yeah… but… wait a minute. Maybe I shouldn't be so mean. I should give these guys the benefit of a doubt. And you know why? Because these guys live in a different world than I do. Let me explain. Okay, these guys are rich, and money attracts people, but that doesn't mean it necessarily attract better people, it just attracts MORE people, and the simple fact is, a LOT of people are douchebags, especially those who think they can get over on people with money. And, ipso facto, women are going to be among this collection of douchebags, but where the guys who are douchebags can only do so much when it comes to trying to get some money from them, women have the persuasive advantage of sexuality on their side, which no doubt makes their requests for money and material items a little harder to resist. In fact, the duplicitous nature of these scandalous women is further exacerbated by knowing that some of them have boyfriends that they are completely willing to cheat on without a second thought in order to achieve their shallow goals. And so, this song is made with that disgust in mind, scoffing at women who would sink so low as to betray the trust of a lover in exchange for diamonds and fancy clothes. That's a sentiment I guess I can get behind Took a broke nigga's bitch Wait, so… YOU'RE the one who's actively trying to have sex with HER? When A rich nigga want ya And your nigga can't do nothing for ya ... Well, then you suck, too! In fact, who the hell are you to judge her?! Seriously, you dis these women for being shallow because she's only interested in your money, but how much better are you, since you're only interested in her body? Both of you are equally shallow jackwagons, because You BOTH know that there's someone who's going to be hurt by what you're doing, and you seem to revel in that fact. And you know what? maybe you could've justify this somewhat by adding in some lines about how her boyfriend cheated on her, and she's getting revenge, or maybe he hasn't been home a lot, and she just wanted to be intimate with someone again, but NOPE. She's just a ho who trades sex for the chance that you'll spend money on her Took a broke nigga's bitch, I can make a broke bitch rich But I don't fuck with broke bitches Sooo… you took someone's girl… and claimed that you can make this broke girl rich… but you don't mess with broke girls… so… did you NOT do the first thing you just said you did? Because… I'm pretty sure taking someone's girl counts as messing with them. But hey, let's go with the other possible interpretation of this awkwardly worded lyric. ultimately, he's saying that he only talks to girls who have their own money, and since these girls he exclusively talks to are already financially stable, that eliminates the chances of them being gold diggers, and maybe he can meet girls who are interested in him because of his *start laughing* sweet, kind, loving personality HAHAHAHA! Oh, God, that's too funny… Got a white girl with some fake titties And I'm sure you're really interested in her sweet loving personality She wanna see a nigga trapped Yeah, sh… ye-- yeah? She wanna fuck all the rappers Uh… what was that part about girls with big boobs trying to get you trapped? Well, maybe, he's just talking about the type of girls I mentioned before that only use sex in order to influence guys to get them fancy clothes and whatnot. But wait, you made it clear that you don't deal with broke women! I'm pretty sure most broke girls can't afford breast implants, especially not with broke boyfriends, so like you said, you only talk to rich girls, the type of girls that don't need your money anyway… so which is it, Chris? Girls who are already rich and don't need your money, or girls who want to exploit your exploitation of them...or lack of proofreading? OR maybe he's saying something else there? She wanna see a nigga TRAP She wanna fuck all the rappers Maybe he's saying that she wants to see him trap, like trapping, you know, the latest metaphor for selling drugs. Well, in that case, ma'am, you're fresh out of luck, because Chris Brown is not a rapper, and he damned sure doesn't sell drugs. Speaking of which though, isn't there another rapper on this song that we have to get through? Maybe he'll lend some some cohesive story or give some focus to this song Okay, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin' Eh, let's not Come on, come on, girl, why you frontin'? Baby show me something Um… hold on… When I call her, she gon' leave And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat Are you sure about that? Come on, come on, girl Why you frontin'? Baby show me something If so, why does it sound like you're begging her? I mean, you could say she's teasing him or something, but that doesn't match up with the rest of the song, where he painted himself as being such a dominant alpha male who took charge of the situation, women just couldn't help but throw themselves at his feet. I mean, he seemed pretty confident in his thesis statement: These hoes ain't loyal! So why, all of a sudden, is he having a hard time with her? These hoes ain't loyal! *I swear, they're not, she's gonna call back, just give it a second…* Seriously, it sounds like things aren't working out as well for him. So, when I hear this: Come on, come on, girl Why you frontin'? Baby show me something You just spent your bread on her And it's all for nothing He sounds like the bad guy in a movie who thinks the love interest is going to double cross the hero, but doesn't realize that it's not going to happen Haha! After all the love and affection you gave her, your lady friend was on my side the entire time! Take him down, Katherine… I said, she was on MY side the entire time! Take 'em down, Katherine! *Katherine cocks gun* Oh-- *raises hands* oh… Anyways, my ultimate problem with this song is that… it's not really catchy, but where the production would usually make up for that in these types of songs, here, it's just kinda limp and inoffensive, and awkwardly unfitting for the topic of the song, which I have no choice but to pay close attention to, and what's revealed is a bunch of jackasses without morals and writing that doesn't showcase a lot of consistency. One minute he's taking broke girls from broke men, and the next he doesn't like broke girls because they're shallow and materialistic, all the while the only thing he wants to do is have sex with them. It's spiteful, hateful, and oddly enough tries to act like it's okay, almost as if he doesn't realize exactly how spiteful and hateful it is, and the bouncy, happy synth line just adds to the confusion. You know, I think another problem I have is that, usually these types of songs about cheating on your boyfriend are justified by something intimate being wrong with the relationship, like the girl wasn't being treated with respect, or, hell, he wasn't listening to her in the bedroom, you know, there's something primal or emotional that's not being responded to due to negligence on the part of the man in question that the singer is taking over for, but here, the only flaw on the part of the other man that's addressed is ""He doesn't have enough money"", which, needless to say, isn't that much of a character flaw, at least not to my poor person brain. I dunno, maybe to rich people, being poor is the equivalent of drowning puppies. And so I have to ask, who is this song for? He doesn't even really seem interested in pleasing her sexually or emotionally, which lets me know that this song CAN'T be for the ladies, aside from the fact that he's calling out every girl he meets as a ho, but it CAN'T be for the fellas, because they never address the other man in the third person, no, they're talking DIRECTLY to you, the listener with the girlfriend, so I have no choice but to assume this song is purely for terrible people who wish to align with this sort of thinking and sing along to it while they cheat on they're spouses, which… hey, I guess those people need their music too, but even so, these guys are so wrapped up in themselves, they never really try to make it appealing to the listener, they just kinda put out this dickish personality as is and expect you to think it's cool on principal, not giving a second thought to how they actually present their personas, and I just don't like it I'd give this a rating, but… that would be validating Chris Brown as a rapper. well, I'm the Rap Critic… most of the time… you don't have to like my-- But wait, you may be asking, ""aren't there several different versions of this song? There's one with Too Short and one with French Montana! You should review those too!"". *look blankly* No, I shouldn't-- *end*",0

Bird & Macdonald,World's Dirtiest Song,"There was an old farmer who lived by a rock He sat in the meadow a-shaking his fist At some boys who were down by the crick (creek) Their feet in the water, their hands on their marbles And playthings, and in days of yore There came a young lady she looked like a Pretty young creature. She sat on the grass She pulled up her dresses and showed us her Ruffles and laces and white fluffy duck (quakc) She said she was learning a nеw way to Bring up her children and learn thеm to knit While the boys in the barnyard where shoveling Refuse and litter from yesterdays hunt While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her Eyes at the fellows as girls sometimes do To make it quite clear that she wanted to Go for a nice pleasant stroll on the grass Then hurry back home for a nice piece of Ice cream and cake that stood three layers tall And after dessert she was ready to Go for another walk down by the dock With any young man with a sizable Roll of one hundreds and a big bulge up front If he asked politely she would show him her Little pet dog who was subject to fits And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her Small tenders hands with movement so quick Then she'd lean on over and suck on his Soda so sweetly till she finished it Then pull down her panties to rub on her Hip, which she bruised when she ran down the halls 'Cause he tried to force her to lick on his Candy so tasty made of butterscotch And then he spread whipped cream All over her cookies she had been baking all night If you think this is dirty you're fucking well right",0

Eminem,Till I Collapse,"( Yo, left, yo, left ) 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired ( Yo, left, right, left ) Feel weak, and when you feel weak ( Yo, left, yo, left ) You feel like you wanna just give up ( Yo, left, right, left ) But you gotta search within you ( Yo, left, yo, left ) Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you ( Yo, left, right, left ) And get that motivation to not give up ( Yo, left, yo, left ) And not be a quitter ( Yo, left, right, left ) No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse 'Til I collapse, I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em 'Til the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em 'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?

How not to go against me, smart And it's absurd how people hang on every word I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static? 'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so [Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem ] 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high?

My Little Pony,Rainbow Rocks,"Female Patron: What?! The Dazzlings: Aria Blaze: That was barely worth the effort, Adagio. I'm tired of fast food. I need a meal. Adagio Dazzle: The energy in this world isn't the same as in Equestria. We can only gain so much power here. Aria Blaze: Ugh! I wish we'd never been banished to this awful place! Adagio Dazzle: Really? I love it here! Sonata Dusk: For realsies? Because I think this place is the worst. Aria Blaze: I think you're the worst, Sonata. Sonata Dusk: Oh, yeah? Well, I think you're— Adagio Dazzle: Ergh! I'll tell you one thing, being stuck here with you two isn't making this world any more bearable. Adagio Dazzle: Did you feel that?! Do you know what that is? Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze: I 'unno. Adagio Dazzle: It's Equestrian magic! Aria Blaze: But this world doesn't have Equestrian magic. Adagio Dazzle: It does now. And we're going to use it to make everyone in this pathetic little world adore us! We used to fight with each other (Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh) That was before we discovered (Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh) That when your friendship is real (Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh) Yeah, you just say what ya feel And the music, yeah, the music Gets us to the top As we learn how the rainbow...

Rainbow Rocks! As we learn how the rainbow... Rainbow Rocks! Sunset Shimmer: Want some help? Apple Bloom: Uh, no thanks. We're good. Sunset Shimmer: Oh. Okay. Pinkie Pie: Sunset Shimmer! Over here! Sunset Shimmer: I had no idea the whole school would be here. Rarity: Quite the eye-catching advertisement, if I do say so myself. Pinkie Pie: And it smells like cake! Fluttershy: It does? Pinkie Pie: I used frosting instead of paste! Applejack: Uh, Fluttershy, you've got a little somethin', uh... Fluttershy: Did I get it? Applejack: Heh, not exactly. Principal Celestia: Good afternoon, students. I just wanted to tell you all how pleased I am that so many of you are going to participate in the first ever Canterlot High School Musical Showcase! Principal Celestia: This is a wonderful opportunity to raise money for all our after-school programs here at CHS. So keep working on those signs and posters. I think it's going to be one of the most exciting events we've had at CHS since the Fall Formal. Sunset Shimmer: Ugh! I am never gonna live that down. Fluttershy: You were pretty bad at the Fall Formal. Sunset Shimmer: A demon. I turned into a raging she-demon. Pinkie Pie: And tried to turn everyone here into teenage zombies for your own personal army! Rarity: Oh, darling, you have us, and we've forgiven you for your past... ahem... booboos. Applejack: To be honest, I'd say the whole experience brought everyone at Canterlot High closer than ever before! Pinkie Pie: One, two, three! There was a time we were apart But that's behind us now See how we've made a brand new start And the future's lookin' up, ah-oh, ah-oh And when you walk these halls You feel it everywhere Yeah, we're the Wondercolts forever, ah-oh, yeah! We are all together (Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh) Now it's better than ever (Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh) You can feel it, we are back (You... can... feel... it...) And I'm so glad that we're better Better than ever Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh Oh yeah, we're better than ever Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh There was a time we couldn't see Past the differences That separated you and me And it left us on our own But now you walk these halls And friends are everywhere Yeah, we're the Wondercolts forever, ah-oh, yeah! We are all together (Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh) Now it's better than ever (Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh) Now that we are back on track (Now... that... we... are...)

Sunset Shimmer: Rarity: I still can't believe that happens when we play! Ooh! I've got to look into some new accessories! Something that looks good in a longer ponytail. Ooh! Maybe some clip-on earrings for when I get those adorable pony ears. Applejack: I just wonder why it happens. Princess Twilight took her crown back to Equestria. Shouldn't that mean she took all the magic back with her? Rainbow Dash: Who cares why it happens? It makes my band totally awesome! Rarity: Oh! Your band? Rainbow Dash: Duh! It was my idea to start the Rainbooms so we could be in the showcase. Plus I'm the lead singer and guitarist. Flash Sentry: Uh, heard you outside. You guys are sounding really tight. Rainbow Dash: Uh, we're getting there. Rarity's still coming in a little late on the second verse, and Applejack's bass solo could use a little work. They'll get it together in time for the showcase. Flash Sentry: Uh, I don't suppose any of our friends from, uh... out of town might come? Uh, it being a special charity event and all. Applejack: Sorry, Flash. I don't think Twilight's gonna be back at Canterlot High any time soon. Flash Sentry: Oh, yeah. Okay. I just, you know, thought I'd ask. Uh, k-keep on rockin' it. Rarity: Well. Someone is quite the smitten kitten. Oh. Sorry. I always forget you and Flash used to be an item. Sunset Shimmer: It's okay. Flash is a great guy and all, but I never really liked-him liked him. I was just using him to become more popular. Ugh! The old me really was just awful, wasn't she? Rarity: Mmm... horrid. Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy: Mm-hmm, uhhh, etc. Pinkie Pie: Yep! Applejack: But the important thing is that you've turned yourself around. Sunset Shimmer: Thanks, Applejack, but I'm not sure everyone else at CHS feels the same way. Vice Principal Luna: Sunset Shimmer, please report to the main foyer. Sunset Shimmer: Gotta run. I volunteered to show some new students around the school. Thought it'd be good for them to get to know the new me before they heard all the stuff about the old me. Rainbow Dash: We've still got a few minutes before lunch starts. What do you say we do ""Awesome As I Wanna Be""? Fluttershy: Um, Rainbow Dash? I was wondering if we could maybe play the song I wrote? Rainbow Dash: We'll get to it. Fluttershy: Oh. Okay. Rainbow Dash: Sunset Shimmer: Hi. Are you the girls I'm supposed to show around? Adagio Dazzle: We are. Sunset Shimmer: Canterlot High is a great school. You're really gonna love it. Adagio Dazzle: Oh, yes, we really sense there's something... magical about this place. Sunset Shimmer: That's the science lab. Computer lab is in there. Oh! We're having a big musical showcase this weekend! The whole school is pretty much rallying around it. Adagio Dazzle: A musical showcase? Sunset Shimmer: I'm sure since you're new, Principal Celestia would let you sign up if you're interested. Aria Blaze: We have been known to sing from time to time. Sonata Dusk: Hello? We sing, like, all the time! It's how we get people to do what we want. Adagio Dazzle: Sonata Dusk: Wha-What did I say? Adagio Dazzle: What you meant to say was that being in a musical showcase sounds like a great way to meet other students. Sonata Dusk: Ohhhh, yeah. Th-What she said I meant to say. That's what I meant. To say. Aria Blaze: And what you would have said if you weren't the worst. Sonata Dusk: You are! Adagio Dazzle: You'll have to excuse them. They're idiots. Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk: Hmph. Sunset Shimmer: Those are pretty. Where did you— Adagio Dazzle: Sorry. These pendants mean an awful lot to us. We'd just hate for anything to happen to them. Applejack: So how was the tour? Sunset Shimmer: I don't know. I mean, these girls, they were... There was something off about them. Pinkie Pie: Like, off like this? Or off like this? Or... Oh, oh! Like— Rainbow Dash: Maybe we should just let her tell us. Sunset Shimmer: That's just it. I can't put my finger on it. They just acted sort of... strange around me. Maybe someone already talked to them. Told them about what I did. So much for making a good first impression. Fluttershy: Uh-huh. Oh, that's probably not it. Adagio Dazzle: This is it, girls. The moment we've been waiting for. Sonata Dusk: Lunch?! Adagio Dazzle: The chance to get our true Equestrian magic back. Sonata Dusk: Oh. Right. Adagio Dazzle: Our voices are just strong enough to make them want something so badly, they'll fight to get it. Aria Blaze: So we're just gonna do what we always do? Stir up some trouble and then feed off the negative energy? Some plan, Adagio. Adagio Dazzle: It won't be the same as the times before! There is Equestrian magic here. Their negative energy will give us the power we need to get this entire world to do our bidding. Sonata Dusk: But we can get lunch after though, right? It's Taco Tuesday! Adagio Dazzle: Just follow my lead. Aria Blaze: Or my lead. Adagio Dazzle: My lead! Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh We heard you want to get together We heard you want to rock this school We've thought of something that is better Something that changes all the rules Why pretend we're all the same When some of us shine brighter? Shine brighter Here's a chance to find your flame Are you a loser or a fighter? Me and you, you and me Why don't we see who is better? We don't have to be one and the same thing Oh, what's so wrong with a little competition? Are you afraid of failing the audition? You're a star and you should know it Yeah, you rise above the rest It doesn't matter who you hurt If you're just proving you're the best Ah, ahh-ahh-ahhh Battle! You wanna win it Let's have a battle, battle of the bands Let's have a battle, we'll go all in it Let's have a battle, battle, battle Battle of the bands Battle! ""Blueberry Cake"": I can beat you! The Dazzlings and students: Battle! ""Cherry Crash"": Ha! You wish! The Dazzlings and students: Battle! Trixie Lulamoon: I so want this! The Dazzlings and students: Battle! ""Captain Planet"": Not if I get it first! Me and you, you and me Why don't we see who is better? We don't have to be one and the same thing Oh, what's so wrong with a little competition? I'm going out and winning the audition Battle! We wanna win it Let's have a battle, battle of the bands Let's have a battle, we'll go all in it Let's have a battle, battle, battle Battle of the bands! Pinkie Pie: Ohhhh. They're that kind of ""off"". Sunset Shimmer: Those three are definitely in possession of some kind of dark magic. How else could you explain what happened back there? Applejack: Don't worry, y'all. We'll let Principal Celestia know all about this and those girls will be kicked to the curb in no time. Last thing she needs is another CHS event almost ruined by some power-crazed lunatic. Er, no offense. Sunset Shimmer: None taken. Principal Celestia: Dark magic? I find that very hard to believe. Those girls came into my office earlier and were absolutely delightful. Vice Principal Luna: Ugh! Perhaps Sunset Shimmer is just eager to make someone else out to be a bad element, so that her actions at the Fall Formal will become old news. Sunset Shimmer: I could see why you might think that, but— Rainbow Dash: That's not what's happening! We saw all of this go down in the cafeteria too! Principal Celestia: Yes, but isn't your band supposed to be part of the Musical Showcase? Rainbow Dash: Yes. Vice Principal Luna: Perhaps you're all just worried that the Dazzlings will steal your spotlight. Applejack: The ""Dazzlings""? Principal Celestia: It's the name of their musical group. That's why they came by my office earlier today – to sign up for the Showcase. Even sang a little song to Vice Principal Luna and I. Applejack: They did? Principal Celestia: Yes. And we think having a Battle of the Bands instead is a marvelous idea. Fluttershy: I can't believe they got to Principal Celestia and Vice Principal Luna too. Rainbow Dash: They've gotten to everybody. Pinkie Pie: Not everybody! Applejack: Pinkie Pie's right. We were there when the Dazzlings were singin' and we weren't affected. It was like we were protected somehow. Rainbow Dash: So let's take them down! It's not like we haven't tangled with dark magic before and totally whooped its sorry butt! Uh, no offense. Sunset Shimmer: None taken. Again. Fluttershy: But that was when Twilight was here. There may be some kind of magic inside us, but it only comes out when we play music. I sure don't know how to use it to... whoop anybody's butt. Rarity: If only we could get a message to Twilight. Maybe she could tell us how to break the spell the Dazzlings have cast on our friends. Rainbow Dash: Well, that's not gonna happen. The portal's closed. Rarity: Rainbow Dash: And I get the feeling they don't exactly have cell phones where she's from. Sunset Shimmer: I may have an idea how we can get in touch with Princess Twilight! Sunset Shimmer: When I was Princess Celestia's student back in Equestria, she gave me this. Even after I abandoned my studies, I held onto it. Deep down, I guess I knew I was making a big mistake, and I wanted to still have a way to reach out to her. Maybe it still works. Rarity: That's a book, darling. What do you mean, ""maybe still works""? Sunset Shimmer: It used to be that if I wrote something here, it would appear in the pages of a book back in Princess Celestia's library. I get a message to her, then she can get a message to Princess Twilight. Rainbow Dash: So what are you waiting for? Get to writing! Sunset Shimmer: Been a long time since I've written these words. ""Dear Princess Celestia..."" Delivery Pony: Excuse me, Princess. Where do you want all these books from Princess Celestia? Twilight Sparkle: The library. Third door on the left. Delivery Pony: Even this one that's glowin' and vibratin'? Fluttershy: What is it, Twilight? Twilight Sparkle: It looks like a message to Princess Celestia from my friends at Canterlot High. Rarity: How is that even possible? Twilight Sparkle: I have no idea, but it... sounds like they need my help. Twilight Sparkle: The way Sunset Shimmer described them, I think these new girls sound an awful lot like... the sirens. Pinkie Pie: Not the sirens! I don't actually know what that is! Twilight Sparkle: The sirens were three beautiful but dangerous creatures who had the power to charm ponies with their music. But to maintain this power, they had to feed on the negativity and distrust of others. The more of this negative energy they consumed, the stronger their voices became, and the farther they could spread their dark magic. Fluttershy: I don't think I like this story very much. Twilight Sparkle: If the sirens had their way, they would have divided and conquered all of Equestria. But a certain Star Swirl the Bearded wasn't having it. Rumor has it he found a way to banish them to another world – one where he believed their magic power would be lost. That world must have been the one where my Canterlot High friends live. Applejack: But Star Swirl must have sent them there ages ago. How come they're just surfacin' now? Twilight Sparkle: I don't know. But if my hunch is right and it is the sirens who have come to Canterlot High, this spell they've cast is just the beginning. My friends need me. I have to get back to them. Rainbow Dash: I hate to burst your bubble, Twilight, but the connection between their world and Equestria will still be totally cut off for a super long time. Pinkie Pie: Okay, first of all, if there was bubble-blowing going on, why wasn't I told about it?! And secondly, if the connection is totally cut off, how was Sunset Shimmer able to get a message to Twilight? Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie, you're a genius! Pinkie Pie: Yeah, I get that a lot. Now about those bubbles... Twilight Sparkle: ...And the interval between the two points is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the separation between the points along three spatial dimensions. Spike: Say what now? Pinkie Pie: Duh! She's gonna take the magic in here and put it in there. That'll make the portal open up so that whenever she wants to, she can go from here to there. There to here. Here to there. Here there! Here there! Here— Applejack: We get the idea! Twilight Sparkle: Now to see if it actually works. Main cast: Ooooh... Main cast: Ahhhhh... Applejack: Don't suppose we could join you this time around? Twilight Sparkle: Better not. It could make things pretty confusing if Canterlot High all of a sudden had two of all of you. Rest of main cast: Spike: But I still get to go, right? There isn't another one of me at Canterlot High. And you never know if you might need your trusty assistant. Twilight Sparkle: Mm-hmm. Spike: Yes! Twilight Sparkle: We won't be gone long. Main cast: Fluttershy: Oh, you be careful, Twilight. Rainbow Dash: Take care! Applejack: Y'all be safe now. Rarity: And don't forget to dress well. Pinkie Pie: Twilight Sparkle: Ready, Spike? Spike: Ready! Rainbow Dash: I'm starting to think she's not coming. Sunset Shimmer, Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie: Twilight! Twilight Sparkle: Oof. I'm back. Rest of main cast: Twilight Sparkle: And I've got some bad news about those new girls. Rest of main cast: Rarity: Oh, I do hate that you had to return at a time of crisis. There's so much catching up to do! Applejack: For starters, a certain blue-haired guitar player was just askin' about you. Twilight Sparkle: Flash Sentry was asking about me?! Isn't that nice? Rarity: Perhaps you would give us just the slightest bit of gossip from your world? Spike: She's got an official title now. The Princess of Friendship! Sunset Shimmer: Wow, that's really impressive. Guess you really were Princess Celestia's prized pupil. Spike: She's even got her own castle! Rarity: A castle?! You have your own castle?!? Eh... Ooh, uh, lovely. Twilight Sparkle: What's new here? I mean, besides your school becoming the target of dangerous magical creatures from Equestria? Rainbow Dash: Yeah, so, that isn't exactly the only strange thing that's happened since you left. Pretty sweet, huh? It happens to all of us when we play. Twilight Sparkle: Hmm. My crown was returned to Equestria, but some of its magic must have remained here at Canterlot High. Now that we're all back together, we can use that magic on the sirens. Just like when we were able to use it on Sunset Shimmer when she turned into that horrifyingly awful winged monster! No offense. Sunset Shimmer: None taken. Heh. I'm used to it. Rainbow Dash: They'll never even know what hit 'em! Applejack: We've got nothin' to worry about now that Twilight's back. Fluttershy: Oh, I'm pretty sure I could find something to worry about. But it won't be the sirens. Twilight Sparkle: The sooner we do this, the better. Any idea where the Dazzlings might be? Pinkie Pie: There's a big party tonight for all the bands who signed up to be in the showcase! That would include the Dazzlings. Twilight Sparkle: Looks like we've got a party to crash. Pinkie Pie: Flash Sentry: I'm gonna get more punch! Flash Sentry: Twilight? Twilight Sparkle: Eh, bumped, into, always, doing? Flash Sentry: What are you doing here? You came back for the big competition, right? Twilight Sparkle: Something like that. Flash Sentry: Huh. Not that there's gonna be any real competition. No one here wants this as bad as my band does! Twilight Sparkle: Can you excuse me for just a minute? Adagio Dazzle: Oh, no! No one's mingling! It's like there's some kind of underlying tension that could bubble to the surface at any minute! Sonata Dusk: It's the fruit punch, isn't it? I knew I used too much grape juice! Adagio Dazzle: It's not the fruit punch! It's us! Aria Blaze: But the punch is awful, too. Sonata Dusk: What do you know about good fruit punch? Aria Blaze: More than you! Sonata Dusk: Do not! Aria Blaze: Do too! Adagio Dazzle: This is just the kickoff party, girls. Imagine what a tizzy they'll be in by the time the Battle of the Bands starts. Twilight Sparkle: There isn't going to be a Battle of the Bands! We're gonna make sure of that! Alright, girls, let's do this! Friendship is magic! Rainbow Dash: Uh, weren't there rainbows and lasers and stuff last time? Twilight Sparkle: I don't understand. We're all together again. Why isn't this working? Spike: You, uh... really need to go ahead and do that whole ""magic of friendship"" thing now. Twilight Sparkle: I'm trying, Spike. I thought the six of us standing together against the sirens would bring out the magic we needed to defeat them. That's what happened before. Adagio Dazzle: Talk about throwing down the gauntlet! This group is obviously serious about winning! A little cocky though, aren't they? Claiming there won't really be a battle. Seems they think they already got this thing all locked up. Trixie Lulamoon: Not if the Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie has anything to do with it! Flash Sentry: Whatever, Trixie! We're the best band at CHS! Apple Bloom: No! The Crusaders are gonna win! Adagio Dazzle: I think we may have found what we're looking for. Or rather, it found us. Aria Blaze: Adagio Dazzle: Magic!! Don't you see?! Everyone else has fallen under our spell. But not these girls. These girls are special. Twilight Sparkle: It doesn't make any sense. I should have been able to create the spark that would help us break their spell. That's how it worked before. Sunset Shimmer: But to defeat me, you drew magic from the crown I was wearing. The sirens' magic comes from their music. So maybe you have to use the same kind of magic to defeat them. Or... maybe not. Twilight Sparkle: No. I think you're onto something. Sunset Shimmer: Really? Twilight Sparkle: It's when you play music that you transform now, right? Applejack: Yup. Ears, tails, the whole shebang. Twilight Sparkle: So maybe the way to use that magic to defeat the sirens is by playing a musical counter-spell! Fluttershy: You mean like a song? Twilight Sparkle: Uh-huh. And in order to free everyone who's been exposed to the sirens' spell, we'll need them all to hear it. Rest of main cast: Hmmm... Rarity: The band competition! That's the next time we can be certain everyone will be in the same place at the same time. Applejack: Guess the Rainbooms are the band to beat. Rarity: And I believe you, Twilight, just became the Rainbooms' newest member. Rest of main cast: Pinkie Pie: So what do you wanna play? Triangle? Sousaphone? Theremin? Soooo magical. Twilight Sparkle: I might take a little too long to learn how to play something with these. I'll just sing. Rainbow Dash: Like, as in, lead singer? Cuz that's usually my gig. This being my band and all. Applejack: It's our band! And, of course, as lead singer. She's the one with the magical know-how to help us pull this thing off. Rainbow Dash: Okay, yeah, that's cool. I'll just use this as a chance to hone my already insanely good lead guitar skills. Twilight Sparkle: It's only temporary. And we don't have to win the Battle of the Bands. We just have to perform during the first round of the competition. Rainbow Dash: Let's get to learning that musical counter-spell! Twilight Sparkle: Well, that's just it. I don't know any. Rest of main cast: Awww... Twilight Sparkle: But I'm sure I could figure out how to write one. Spike: Totally! Twilight can write a spell like it's nobody's business. That's pretty much how she got to become a princess in Equestria. Twilight Sparkle: Technically, I helped finish a spell. And there was a little more to it than that, Spike. Spike: Yeah, whatever. Twilight Sparkle: I've got this. C'mon! Applejack: Where're you goin'? Twilight Sparkle: Well, last time we were here, Spike and I spent the night in the library. Pinkie Pie: Are you crazy?! We're besties now! Slumber party at my house! Pinkie Pie: Status update: ""Okie-dokie-lokie."" Rainbow Dash: Applejack: Hey! I was about to beat you! Rainbow Dash: I doubt it. So, Twilight, how is that counter-spell comin'? Twilight Sparkle: Huh? Oh, uh, good. Great. Thanks for letting me use your notebook, Fluttershy. I really like the song you wrote for the Rainbooms. Fluttershy: Thanks. Hopefully one day, we'll get a chance to play it. Rainbow Dash: Applejack: Hey! Rarity: Twilight, I think I speak for all of us when I say I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come back to help us. Rest of main cast: Uh-huh. Applejack: Darn tootin'. Pinkie Pie: Pizza's here! Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie: Don't you want any pizza? Rest of main cast: Twilight Sparkle: No. That's not gonna work. Sunset Shimmer: Hey, Twilight. You're up late. Twilight Sparkle: Just looking over the counter-spell. We only get one shot at this. It has to be perfect. Sunset Shimmer: We really are lucky you're here. Twilight Sparkle: That's what everyone keeps telling me. Sunset Shimmer: Who could possibly need this much whipped cream? Must be nice to have everyone always looking to you for answers to their problems... instead of waiting for you to cause a problem. Twilight Sparkle: Just because everyone expects something from you doesn't mean it's guaranteed to happen. Sunset Shimmer: Well, that doesn't stop them from expecting it. Twilight Sparkle: Which only makes things harder because the last thing you want to do is... Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer: ...let everybody down. Sunset Shimmer: Waaah! Maud: Boulder was hungry. Sunset Shimmer: I still can't get over the fact that she's related to Pinkie Pie. Twilight Sparkle: You and me both! Sunset Shimmer: I better get some sleep. Good luck with the counter-spell. Not that you'll need it. This must be nothing compared with the stuff you're expected to deal with as a princess in Equestria. Twilight Sparkle: Sunset Shimmer? ...Never mind. It's not important. No, I have to be able to do this. I have to. Hey, hey, listen We've got a message for you We're not all alike But our friendship is true Yeah, we're really different But we still get along So hey, hey, listen to our song You may think you're in control But we're here to prove you wrong With the friendship in our music With the power of our song Gonna stomp our feet, clap our hands With the magic of friendship Gonna stop your evil plan Spike: Eh, that sounded... way better than the last... five times you've played it. Heh heh. Big McIntosh: Nnope. Spike: Rainbow Dash: I think it's pretty obvious what's going wrong with this counter-spell. Applejack: You're turnin' what should be the chorus into a five-minute guitar solo? Rainbow Dash: I have to pick up the slack somehow! Are you guys even trying?! Fluttershy: I'm trying. Twilight Sparkle: It's fine. It'll be fine. One more time from the top! Rarity: Or, perhaps we could take a short break, try on some of the wardrobe choices I've put together? I'm particularly fond of this one. Eh, of course we could always go with something a bit more modern. Applejack: We're tryin' to save our school here. Enough with the costumes! Rarity: Oh, you can never have enough costumes! Pinkie Pie: She just wants to make things fun! Isn't that what being in a band supposed to be? Sunset Shimmer: You don't have time for any of this! You're supposed to check in at the Battle of the Bands in fifteen minutes! Main cast: Oh, no! Twilight Sparkle: What? But it's not ready! If we play our counter-spell in the first round and it doesn't work, the sirens will know what we're up to and make sure we don't get a chance to play it again! Applejack: Then we'll have to buy ourselves some time so you can keep workin' on it! Rarity: But how do you propose we do that? Rainbow Dash: We compete in the Battle of the Bands for real! I take over lead vocals again and we stay alive until the finals! We unleash the counter-spell then! You'll have figured it out by finals, right? Spike: Of course she will. Twilight Sparkle's never met a problem she couldn't solve. Right, Twilight? Twilight Sparkle: Right. Rainbow Dash: Then let's go win us a Battle of the Bands! Principal Celestia: Welcome to the first ever Canterlot High School Battle of the Bands. I believe I speak for everyone when I say it is by far the greatest thing we have ever done here at this school! Principal Celestia: We are so glad our three newest students encouraged us to turn this event into something exciting! Vice Principal Luna: But, as this is now a competition, we can only choose one winner. Who is it going to be? Male Student: You're the worst thing to happen! Adagio Dazzle: You feel that, girls? Our true power is being restored. Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk: Adagio Dazzle: And that's before we've tapped into the strongest magic here. Aria Blaze: But the Rainblossoms, or whatever they're called, aren't under our spell. How exactly are we supposed to get to their magic? Adagio Dazzle: The Rainbooms are just as capable of falling apart as anyone else. They just need a little... push in the wrong direction. I have a feeling everyone here is going to be lining up to give them a shove. Aw, yeah! Snips and Snails indahouse, yo! They call me MC Snips and that ain't no lie My favorite food is like pumpkin pie I'm DJ Snazzy Snails, I like whales When I go to the beach, I always bring my pails Everybody knows my favorite color is orange My rhymes are so fly, they're better than... um... Than an orange, yo! Yeah! Yeah! Represent! What do we... What do we do now? Get off the stage, I'd like to leave right now Bam! That just happened! Aw, yeah! We out! Snips and Snails outta here! Principal Celestia: Please do not drop the microphones. Snips: Yeah! Bam! Snails: Snips: In your face, Rainbooms! Applejack: Least we know one group who won't stand in the way of us gettin' to the finals. Rainbow Dash: Let's get ready to rock! Pinkie Pie: Wait! Where's Rarity? Rarity: Oh! Here! I'm here! Rarity: We will be performing in front of an audience. I'm not going to wear something fabulous? Hmph. Applejack: Guh... Twilight Sparkle: Remember, we have to be good enough to make it through but not so good we let the sirens see the magic within us. They could realize we plan to use it against them. Rainbow Dash: Got it! Be cool enough to win, but not so cool that we end up showing off the whole ears and tails and rainbows thing. Sooo... about twenty percent less cool. Pinkie Pie: One! Two! We've just got the day to get ready And there's only so much time to lose Because tonight, yeah, we're here to party So let's think of something fun to do We don't know (we don't know) what's gonna happen We just know (we just know) it's gonna feel right All our friends are here And it's time to ignite the lights! Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight Shake your tail, shake your tail Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight Shake your tail, shake your tail So what you didn't get it right the first time Apple Bloom: Boring! Laugh it off, no one said it is a crime Do your thing, you know you're an original Your ideas are so funny that they're criminal Ohhh-ahh! Twilight Sparkle: We've just got the day to get ready And there's only so much time to lose Because tonight, yeah, we're here to party So let's think of something fun to do Snips and Snails: Snips: Awesome. We don't know (we don't know) what's gonna happen We just know (we just know) it's gonna feel right All our friends are here And it's time to ignite the lights! Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight Shake your tail, shake your tail Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight Shake your tail, shake your tail Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight Shake your tail, shake your tail Rarity: Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight Shake your tail, shake your tail Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight! Principal Celestia and Vice Principal Luna: Rarity: Ruined! Absolutely ruined! Applejack: Rarity, were you tryin' to make us lose out there?! Rarity: Wh- Oh! This was not my fault! This was an act of sabotage! Applejack: Yeah, well, whoever did this couldn't have done this if you didn't insist on dressin' like... like... this! We need to sound good! Is there some reason that concept seems to escape you? Rainbow Dash: And what was with the confetti, Pinkie Pie? How am I supposed to shred if there's paper stuck in my frets?! Fluttershy: It was pretty distracting... Pinkie Pie: Ugh! Says the girl who was running from a light the whole time! A light! Sunset Shimmer: You still sounded much better than most of the other bands. I'm sure you'll make it to the next round. But it won't matter if you don't have that counter-spell ready. You all find a place to practice where the sirens can't hear you. I'll keep an eye on things around here. Derpy: Twilight Sparkle: I don't think we should use a classroom. We really need to stop bumping into each other like this. Flash Sentry: Uh, you guys hear something? Drummer: Uhh-uhh. Bassist: Aw, nope. Twilight Sparkle: I said, we have to stop— Flash Sentry: There it is again. So annoying. Twilight Sparkle: Why are you acting like this? I thought we were friends. Flash Sentry: Yeah, and then you decide to come back here just so you can beat me in the Battle of the Bands. I want this, Twilight, and you're trying to take it from me! Some friend. Twilight Sparkle: That's not why— Applejack: Come on, Twilight. We've got things to do. Flash Sentry: You really think you're gonna help them?! Ha! I bet you have no idea what you're even doing! Adagio Dazzle: Tears already? This is only the first round. Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk: Principal Celestia: The next band to take the stage will be Trixie and the Illusions. Adagio Dazzle: Better head back. We're supposed to go on after Trixie. Sunset Shimmer: You're never gonna get away with this. Adagio Dazzle: Why? Because you didn't? Oh, we know all about you, Sunset Shimmer. You've got quite the reputation at Canterlot High. Sunset Shimmer: I've changed! I'm in a much better place now! Aria Blaze: Waiting in the wings while your friends have all the fun? Adagio Dazzle: Oh, yes, you girls are so tight. And yet... they didn't ask you to be in the band. Aria Blaze: Probably afraid no one would want to see them play if she was in the group. Sonata Dusk: Too bad! So sad! Adagio Dazzle: If it's any consolation, no one is going to remember you at all by the time we're done. Adagio Dazzle: Remember, girls. We want to save the good stuff for when our full power has been restored. Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh You didn't know that you fell Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh Now that you're under our spell Blindsided by the beat Clapping your hands, stomping your feet You didn't know that you fell Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh Now you've fallen under our spell Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh We've got the music, makes you move it Got the song that makes you lose it We say ""jump"", you say ""how high?"" Put your hands up to the sky We've got the music, makes you move it Got the song that makes you lose it We say ""jump"", you say ""how high?"" Put your hands up to the sky Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh You didn't know that you fell Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh Now that you're under our spell Listen to the sound of my voice Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh Soon you'll find you don't have a choice Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh Captured in the web of my song Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh Soon you'll all be singing along Oh, whoa, oh We've got the music, makes you move it Got the song that makes you lose it We say ""jump"", you say ""how high?"" Put your hands up to the sky We've got the music, makes you move it Got the song that makes you lose it We say ""jump"", you say ""how high?"" Put your hands up to the sky Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh You didn't know that you fell Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh Now that you're under our spell Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh You didn't know that you fell Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh Now that you're under our Spell Sunset Shimmer: This is it! Last round and you're in the finals! Unless you think the counter-spell is ready to be played now. Applejack: Don't worry, Twilight. Finals aren't until tonight. We'll get in a little more practice before we're supposed to hit the stage. We won't let you down! Rest of main cast: Twilight Sparkle: You won't let me down... Fluttershy: Um, I was just wondering. We haven't played any of my songs yet, and... Rainbow Dash: It's the semifinals. We gotta do ""Awesome As I Wanna Be"". Fluttershy: Don't know why I even asked... ...I got tricks up my sleeve See me dominate 'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat! Crowd: Principal Celestia: Fantastic! Trixie Lulamoon: Hmph. You're never gonna top that performance, ""Rain-goons"". You shouldn't be allowed to when you have such a big advantage over the rest of us. Rainbow Dash: My superior guitar playing and off-the-charts awesome singing voice? Trixie Lulamoon: Oh, don't be ridiculous. I mean her! If you were really all that, Rainbow Dash, you wouldn't have needed to bring in some magical ringer to have half a chance. Everyone's talking about it. Rainbow Dash: Ha! Puh-leeze! I could win this thing as a solo act and everybody knows it! Trixie Lulamoon: Sure you could. Main cast: Pinkie Pie: She's gone! Oh, wait. There she is. Principal Celestia: Next up, the Rainbooms. Spike: Knock 'em dead, Rainbooms! Sunset Shimmer: I'll be here... just... watching. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Awesome as I wanna be Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Awesome as I wanna be First you see me riding on a sonic boom Got my guitar shreddin' up my latest tune There is nothin' you can do to beat me I'm so good that you can't defeat me Yeah, I'm awesome, take caution Watch out for me, I'm awesome as I wanna be (Yeah!) I'm awesome, take caution Watch out for me, I'm awesome as I wanna be Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Fluttershy: Flash Sentry: Now that's the bad girl we love to hate! Crowd: Octavia Melody: I knew she was still trouble! Male student: The real Sunset Shimmer is back! Sunset Shimmer: No. It isn't like that. Rainbow Dash: What was that?! Sunset Shimmer: You were showing them your magic. I-I didn't know what else to do. Rarity: Ugh. Close the curtains? Unplug her amp? Give us a chance to deal with the situation? Sunset Shimmer: I'm sorry, I just wanted to help. Rainbow Dash: Yeah, well, you didn't. Applejack: None of this would've happened if you weren't tryin' to show off – as usual. Trixie Lulamoon: Good show, ""Rain-brooms"". I especially liked the part where Sunset Shimmer, in a fit of jealous rage, knocked out Rainbow Dash mid-guitar solo! Sunset Shimmer: It wasn't a fit of jealous rage! Trixie Lulamoon: If you say so. Ooh! Looks like they've already decided who'll be moving on to the finals! I'm guessing it wasn't too difficult a decision. The Dazzlings: Sunset Shimmer: Huh? Rarity: What can we do? There isn't gonna be another opportunity for us to play. And I had the most gorgeous outfit for the finals! Applejack: Yup, 'cause that's the real tragedy here, Rarity – that you won't get to play dress-up! Rarity: You know perfectly well that is not what I meant! Rainbow Dash: You guys wanna keep it down? They're about to announce who's moving on. Fluttershy: Who are you kidding? You know it isn't gonna be us. Principal Celestia: The band that will be joining the Dazzlings in tonight's finals... The Rainbooms! Trixie Lulamoon: What?! Main cast: Huh? Pinkie Pie: Did they just say, ""the Rainbooms""?! Trixie Lulamoon: This isn't over! Principal Celestia: Congratulations, girls. You deserve it. Pinkie Pie: Seriously?! We didn't even finish our—! Adagio Dazzle: See you at tonight's big show, Rainbooms. We are really looking forward to it. Rainbow Dash: Yeah, well... not as much as we are! Crowd: Photo Finish: Zis never should haf been you, Rainbooms! Crowd: Trixie Lulamoon: This is a travesty! A travesty! Adagio Dazzle: It really is! The Rainbooms don't deserve to be in the finals. Not when your band was so much better in the semis. Aria Blaze: And wanted it so much more. Adagio Dazzle: Alas, this is the way it's going to be. Dazzlings vs. Rainbooms. Sonata Dusk: Unless, of course, the Rainbooms don't manage to make it to their set or held up for some reason. Trixie Lulamoon: Hmm... Rainbow Dash: Check, one, two. Testing, testing... Testing...! Fluttershy: This doesn't make any sense. We were awful. Doesn't anybody else think it's strange that we're the ones that made it to the finals? Trixie Lulamoon: Very strange. Rainbow Dash: What are you doing here, Trixie? Pretty sure the losers are supposed to be up there in the cheap seats. Trixie Lulamoon: The Great and Powerful Trixie is the most talented girl at Canterlot High. It is I who deserves to be in the finals. And I will not... ...be denied! Rainbooms and Sunset Shimmer: Trixie Lulamoon: See you never! Adagio Dazzle: Told you someone would give them a shove. Sonata Dusk: She didn't shove them. She pulled a lever. Aria Blaze: Go back to sleep, Sonata. Ya better believe I got tricks up my sleeve And I captivate 'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat Oh, whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh Ya better believe I got tricks up my sleeve See me dominate 'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat Oh, whoa, oh oh oh oh Rainbow Dash: Applejack: Give it up, Rainbow Dash. You've been tryin' at this for hours. It's not gonna open. Twilight Sparkle: Maybe it doesn't even matter that we're trapped down here. I don't think the counter-spell would have worked anyway. Applejack: Of course it would have worked, Twilight. Assumin' a certain band member didn't try to hog the spotlight the whole time we were tryin' to play it! Rainbow Dash: Hey! If you wanna tell Twilight she's getting a little too caught up trying to be the new leader of this band, you don't have to be all cryptic about it. Rarity: She was talking about you, Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash: Me?! I'm just trying to make sure my band rocks as hard as it needs to! Rarity, Applejack, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie: OUR BAND!! Twilight Sparkle: But why wasn't it working? I should know what to do. How could I not know what to do? How could I have failed like this? Applejack: It might've been your idea to start a band, but it's not just your band, Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash: I'm the one who writes all the songs! Fluttershy: I write songs! You just never let us play any of them! Rarity: I had the most perfect outfits for us to wear! Applejack: Again with the costumes! No one cares what we're wearin'! Rarity: I care, Applejack! So sorry if I enjoy trying to make a creative contribution to the band! Pinkie Pie: Hey! Anybody here remember fun?! I'll give you a hint: It's the exact opposite of being in the Rainbooms! Rainbow Dash: I wish I never asked any of you to be in my band! Rarity: I wish I'd never agreed to be in it!!!! Fluttershy and Applejack: Me neither! Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity and Pinkie Pie: Ya better believe I got tricks up my sleeve See me dominate 'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat! Trixie Lulamoon: Try to top that! Adagio Dazzle: Oh, gosh! I don't know if we can! The Dazzlings: Ahh, ah-ah, ahh Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity and Pinkie Pie: Sunset Shimmer: Stop! You have to stop! This is what they've been after all along! They're feeding off of the magic inside you! Applejack: How can they be using our magic? It's the magic of friendship. Sunset Shimmer: Ever since you started this band, you've been letting little things get to you. I never said anything 'cause I didn't feel like it was my place. Not when I'm so new to this whole ""friendship"" thing. I still have a lot to learn. But I do know that if you don't work out even the smallest problems right at the start, the magic of friendship can be turned into something else. Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe all this tension was happening right under my nose and I didn't realize it. I'm supposed to be the one with all the answers. And all I've done since I got here is let you down. Sunset Shimmer: I don't think anyone is supposed to have all the answers. But you can count on your friends to help you find them. Twilight Sparkle: I think you already have. C'mon! We need to get out of here! Twilight Sparkle: Spike! Spike: Sorry I took so long. I had to find somebody who wasn't under the sirens' spell to help me get you out. Twilight Sparkle: Why isn't she under their spell? Spike: Never takes off her headphones. Applejack: Come on, y'all! Time to prove we've still got the magic of friendship inside us! Twilight Sparkle: And there's only one way to do it! Pinkie Pie: We're getting the band back together? Rainbow Dash: We're getting our band back together! Pinkie Pie: Whee! Rarity: Ooh, which version of the counter-spell are we going to play? Twilight Sparkle: I don't think it matters what song we play, as long as we play it together as friends. Rainbow Dash: I know just the song. Fluttershy's written a really great one. Fluttershy: Applejack: We're about to save the world here. Personally, I think we should do it in style. Rarity? Rarity: I thought you'd never ask! Ah-ha, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah Ah-ha, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah Welcome to the show Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah We're here to let you know Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah Our time is now Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah Your time is running out Ah, ah, ah Ah-ha, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah... Rainbow Dash: How are we supposed to play over them from up here? The Rainbooms: Pinkie Pie: Awesome! Rainbow Dash: Sweet! Feel the wave of sound As it crashes down You can't turn away We'll make you wanna sta-a-a-ay We will be adored Tell us that you want us We won't be ignored It's time for our reward Now you need us Come and heed us Nothing can stop us now Oh-oh, oh-whoa-oh I've got the music in me Oh-oh, oh-whoa-oh Don't need to hear a crowd Cheering out my name I didn't come here seeking Infamy or fame The one and only thing That I am here to bring Is music, is the music Is the music in my soul Gonna break out (Out!) Set myself free, yeah Let it all go (Go!) Just let it be, yeah Find the music in your heart Let the music make you start To set yourself apart Adagio Dazzle: So the Rainbooms want to turn this into a real Battle of the Bands? Then let's battle! What we have in store (ah-ah) All we want and more (ah-ah) We will break on through (ah-ah) Now it's time to finish you! Twilight Sparkle: Sirens: Twilight Sparkle: Sunset Shimmer, we need you! You're never gonna bring me down You're never gonna break this part of me My friends are here to bring me 'round Not singing just for popularity We're here to let you know That we won't let it go Our music is a bomb and it's about to blow And you can try to fight But we have got the light of Friendship on our side! Got the music in our hearts We're here to blow this thing apart And together, we will never Be afraid of the dark Here to sing our song out loud Get you dancing with the crowd As the music of our friendship Survives, survives! Got the music in our hearts We're here to blow this thing apart And together, we will never Be afraid of the dark Here to sing our song out loud Get you dancing with the crowd As the music of our friendship Survives, survives, survives! We will be adored Tell us that you want us We won't be ignored It's time for our reward... Crowd: Sunset Shimmer: Guess that explains why these were so special to them. Twilight Sparkle: Without those pendants and the magic you brought here from Equestria, they're just three harmless teenage girls. Flash Sentry: Rainbooms rule! That was amazing! Sunset Shimmer and Main cast sans Twilight: Trixie Lulamoon: You may have vanquished the Dazzlings, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie! Main cast, Sunset Shimmer, and Flash Sentry: Pinkie Pie: She's gone! Oh, wait. There she is. Trixie Lulamoon: Trixie's okay! Rainbow Dash: You know, Twilight is going back to Equestria soon. The Rainbooms could really use someone to help Fluttershy on backup vocals. Sunset Shimmer: I also play guitar. Rainbow Dash: We'll see. Applejack: Sure wish you could stay longer. Twilight Sparkle: Me too. But I have responsibilities in Equestria that I have to get back to. Its citizens need me. But now I can go through the portal whenever I need to. This isn't goodbye. It's just goodbye 'til next time. Ready? Spike: Ready! Sunset Shimmer: Dear Princess Twilight, Missing you already, and I hope you'll be back soon. Things are definitely looking up for me here at Canterlot High. But I know I still have a lot to learn about friendship. Hope you don't mind if I write to you for advice when I need it. Your friend, Sunset Shimmer. Rainbow Dash: You ready or what? Sunset Shimmer: Ready! Pinkie Pie: One! Two! Three! Four!

Kidz Bop Kids,How Far I’ll Go,"I've been staring at the edge of the water Long as I can remember, never really knowing why I wish I could be the perfect daughter But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try Every turn I take, every trail I track Every path I make, every road leads back To the place I know where I cannot go Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me And no one knows, how far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island seems so happy, on this island Everything is by design I know everybody on this island has a role, on this island So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride, I can make us strong I'll be satisfied if I play along But the voice inside sings a different song What is wrong with me? See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding But no one knows, how deep it goes And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me And let me know What's beyond that line, will I cross that line? See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me And no one knows, how far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know How far I'll go",1

Kevin Bloody Wilson,The Kid (He Swears a Bit),"First time he'd ever had shoes on, very first day at school And the sweet young teacher, straight from college, her first day there too His Mum and Miss Brown chatted about living out there in the scrub And how he'd grown up with the shearers and how he'd done it pretty rough But he could cull and crutch and dip and dag though he was only six ""But I think it's best to warn you"", she said, ""he swears a little bit"" ""I'll keep me eyes on him"", Miss Brown promised ""He can be my helping hand, and I'm sure we'll be the best of friends, now won't we, little man?"" He didn't even raise his eyes, he just bit his bottom lip and shuffled sand with his new shoes and said ""I don't give a shit"" ""Now, now"", she said ""if you don't swear I'll let you ring the bell"", he said ""You're supposed to be the fuckin' gun, go ring the cunt yourself"" ""But tell me what time's fuckin' smoko? What time do we knock off? And I'm busting for a fuckin' shit so where's the thunderbox? And do we get our daily rollie weed and six cold cans of piss? And can any bastard tell me, whose fuckin' show is this?"" But that didn't seem to phase her, she just knelt down next to him And sweetly smiled and softly whispered, ""We'd better start again Because you must learn not to swear like that because it's against the rules"" He said ""Well, stick your rules, and stick your shoes and stick your fuckin' school"" But she just grit her teeth and forced a smile, and didn't let it show She just said ""Let's both go on the veranda and we'll have another go Now if you stand here beside me, you can help me call the children up"" he said ""You don't need me to help ya, what you need's a fuckin' mutt"" But again it just bounced off her, and she let his comment pass Had've been me I would've kicked that midget mongrel up the arse But she said ""Now listen carefully boys and girls, and please don't make a sound"" ""You fuckin' tell 'em lady, now you bastards, get around And find out what time's fuckin' smoko? What time do we knock off? And I'm busting for a fuckin' shit where to find the thunderbox? And do we get our daily rollie weed and six cold cans of piss? And can any bastard tell me, whose fuckin' show is this?"" That kid had turned the school right on its ear And come recess time, two teachers'd had fuckin' heart attacks and another six resigned But through the barrage and the bedlam, Miss Brown just keep her cool And just ignored that little arsehole who was tryin' to wreck the school The head said ""just hide here in the staffroom until things settle down It's really quite a lovely school, you'll get to like it here Miss Brown"" But back out side there in the schoolyard things were getting pretty hot The little cunt had formed a union and signed all the other mongrels up 'Cos he'd learned proper from the shearers, and remembered what they'd taught He'd promised one day on and three days off, and if it rained, don't come at all But meanwhile, back the in the building the staff were shitting broken glass As the little sawn off savages started chantin' their demands They said ""Oi, what time's fuckin' smoko? What time do we knock off? And we're busting for a fuckin' shit, where's the thunderbox? And do we get our daily rollie weed and six cold cans of piss? And can any bastard tell us, whose fuckin' show is this?"" The shit-scared head just shook and trembled, as he sobbed ""Stick with me staff!"" As one by one those left behind, up and bolted for their cars And they knew their head had gone ta-das and his spring had finally sprung When he pissed and shit his daks, and started screaming for his Mum (Muuuuum, Muuuuum!) Then Miss Brown volunteered and said, ""I know I'm only new But I spent my life around shearing sheds, I'll see what I can do Because my brothers are all shearers and I was once their roust-about So I'll go out there if you like, and try and sort the problem out"" She ducked and weaved and sidestepped, as she walked across the yard And straight up to the little cunt, drinking rum and playing cards And when she decked him with a four by two, the whole school stopped and gawked, and she said ""Listen here you little cunt, we need to fuckin' talk 'Cos there ain't no fuckin' smoko, I'll say when we knock off I'll tell you when to fuckin' shit too, 'cos I'm the fuckin' boss You can forget your fuckin' rollie weed, you'll get fuck all here for free And if you want to know who runs the show... fuckin' ME!""",0

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name (Mike!) He doesn't need his name up in lights He just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic He feels so unlike everybody else, alone In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary It's all about reality and making some noise Making a story, making sure his clique stays up That means when he puts it down, Tak's picking it up, let's go Who the hell is he, anyway?

No, he's living proof (Proof), got him rocking the booth He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice (Juice) Him and his crew are known around as one of the best Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard It seems like he's never got time Because he writes every note and he writes every line And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind It's like a design is written in his head, every time Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed?

Bloodhound Gang,A Lap Dance Is So Much Better When The Stripper Is Crying,"I was lonelier than Kunta Kinte at a Merle Haggard concert that night I strolled on into Uncle Limpy's Hump Palace lookin' for love. It had been a while In fact, three hundred and sixty-five had come and went since that midnight run haulin' hog to Shakey Town on I-10. I had picked up this hitchhiker that was sweatin' gallons through a pair of Daisy-Duke cut-offs and one of those Fruit of the Loom tank-tops Well, that night I lost myself to ruby red lips, milky white skin and baby blue eyes. Name was Russell Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' Well, I find it's quite a thrill When she grinds me against her will Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' Well, faster than you can say ""shallow grave"", this pretty little thing come up to me and starts kneadin' my balls like hard-boiled eggs in a tube sock. Said her name was Bambi and I said, ""Well that's a coincidence darlin', 'cause I was just thinkin' about skinnin' you like a deer."" Well, she smiled, had about as much teeth as a Jack-O-Lantern, and I went on to tell her how I would wear her face like a mask as I do my little kooky dance. And then she told me to shush. I guess she could sense my desperation 'Course, it's hard to hide a hard-on when you're dressed like Minnie Pearl So, Bambi's goin' on about how she can make all my fantasies come true. So I says, ""Even this one I have where Jesus Christ is jackhammering Mickey Mouse in the doo-doo hole with a lawn dart as Garth Brooks gives birth to something resembling a cheddar cheese log with almonds on Santa Claus's tummy-tum?"" Well, ten beers, twenty minutes and thirty dollars later, I'm parkin' the beef bus in tuna town if you know what I mean. Got to nail her back at her trailer. Heh. That rhymes I have to admit it was even more of a turn-on when I found out she was doin' me to buy baby formula Day or so had passed when I popped the clutch, gave the tranny a spin and slid on into the Stinky Pinky Gulp N' Guzzle Big Rig Snooze-A-Stop. There I was browsin' through the latest issue of Throb when I saw Bambi starin' at me from the back of a milk carton. Well, my heart just dropped So, I decided to do what any good Christian would: You can not imagine how difficult it is to hold a half gallon of moo juice and polish the one-eyed gopher when you're doin' seventy-five in an eighteen-wheeler. I never thought missing children could be so sexy Did I say that out loud?",0

Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen,Hot Rod Lincoln,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin' If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln."" Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace That story is true, I'm here to say I was drivin' that Model A It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up That Model A body makes it look like a pup It's got eight cylinders; uses them all It's got overdrive, just won't stall With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust With 4.11 gears you can really get lost It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared The brakes are good, tires fair Pulled out of San Pedro late one night The moon and the stars was shinin' bright We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill Passing cars like they was standing still All of a sudden in a wink of an eye A Cadillac sedan passed us by I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!"" By then the taillight was all you could see Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind Took my foot off the gas and man alive I shoved it on down into overdrive Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten My speedometer said that I hit top end My foot was glued like lead to the floor That's all there is and there ain't no more Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense And telephone poles looked like a picket fence They said, ""Slow down! I see spots! The lines on the road just look like dots."" Took a corner; sideswiped a truck Crossed my fingers just for luck My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts The guy beside me was white as a ghost Smoke was comin' from out of the back When I started to gain on that Cadillac Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?
